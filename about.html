            <h1>My Name Is Meya</h1>
        <p>I am currently eightteen and I was born and raised in Indiana. Growing up I wanted to be more of a digital/traditional artist. As I got older I realized I wanted to be into graphic design. I also like to create ocs which stand for "Original Character". I like to create art using custom characters and building stories of off them.</p>
