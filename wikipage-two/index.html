 Graphic design is a proffesion,[2] academic discipline[3][4][5] and applied art whose activity consists in projecting visual communications intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives.[6] Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of design[1] and of the fine arts. Its practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral thinking using manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.

  The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.[7]

Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in the aviation world[8] or space exploration.[9][10] In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the production of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.
</p>
With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,[11] graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of rise of printing in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the Industrial Revolution. From there it emerged as a distinct profession in the West, closely associated with advertising in the 19th century[12] and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who develop them.[13]
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<hr>
<a href="william addison dwiggins">William Addison Dwiggins</a> is often credited with first using the term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,[14] although it appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article about technical education for printers:[15]

… The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating. …

  A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the <a href="california school of arts & Crafts">California School of Arts & Crafts</a> advertised a course titled Graphic Design and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes were taught by <a href="Frederick Meyer">Frederick Meyer</a>.[16]

  n both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of <a href="visual communication">visual communication</a> in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, <a href="languages">languages</a> and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human experience."[17]

Although he lacked artistic training, <a href="Frank Pick">Frank Pick</a> led the Underground Group design and publicity movement. The first Underground station signs were introduced in 1908 with a design of a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center and the name of the station. The station name was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 1916 when Pick used the expertise of <a href="Edward Johnston">Edward Johnston</a> to design a new typeface for the Underground.

The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."[33]

<h3>Applications</h3>

  The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.
<h3>Typography</h3>

<p>
  Typohraphy includes type design, modifying type <a href="glyphs">glyphs</a> and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using ilustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), keming (the space between two specific characters), and leading (line spacing).

  Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to  a typewriter or a cintage report.[35]

<h3>Page layout</h3> 
Further information: <a href="grid (graphic design)">Grid (graphic design)</a>
<p>Page layout deals with the arrangement of elemetns (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of <a href="type">type (text), <a href="images">images</a> (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a <a href="dieline">dieline</a> for elements that are not printed with ink such as <a href="die">die</a>/<a href="laser cutting">laser cutting, <a href="foil stamping">foil stamping, or <a href="blind embossing">blind embossing.</a>

<h3>Grids</h3>
<p>
A grid serves as a method of arranging both space and information, allowing the reader to easily comprehend the overall project. Furthemore, a grid functions as a container for information and a means of establishing and maintaining order. Despite grids being utilized for centuries, many graphic designer associate them with Swiss design. The desire for order in the 1940s resulted in a highly systematic approach for visualizing information. However, grids were later regarded as tedious and uninteresting, earning the label of "designersaur". Today, grids are once again considered crucial tools for professionals, whether they are novices or veterans.
