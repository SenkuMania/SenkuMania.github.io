World of Warcraft was a major critical and commercial success upon its original release in 2004 and quickly became the most popular MMORPG of all time, reaching a peak of 12 million subscribers in 2010.[4] The game had over one hundred million registered accounts by 2014[5] and by 2017, had grossed over $9.23 billion in revenue, making it one of the highest-grossing video game franchises of all time. The game has been cited by gaming journalists as the greatest MMORPG of all time and one of the <a href="greatest video games of all time">greatest video games of all time</a>and has also been noted for its long lifespan, continuing to receive developer support and expansion packs over 15 years since its initial release.[6][7][8] In 2019, a <a href="vanilla">vanilla</a> version of the game titled <a href="World of Warcraft Classic">World of Warcraft Classic</a> was launched, allowing players to experience the base game before any of its expansions launched,[9][10] with versions of Classic for the second and third expansions being released subsequently,[11][12] with minor changes.[13] In 2022, Blizzard and <a href="NetEase">NetEase</a> cancelled an unannounced World of Warcraft mobile spin-off game.

  As with other MMORPGs, players control a <a href="character avatar">character avatar</a> within a game world in <a href="third">third</a>- or <a href="first-person">first-person</a> view, exploring the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing quests, and interacting with <a href="non-player characters">non-player characters</a> (NPCs) or other players. Also similar to other MMORPGs, World of Warcraft requires the player to pay for a <a href="subscription">subscription</a> by using a credit or debit card, using <a href="prepaid">prepaid</a> Blizzard game cards or using a WoW Token purchased <a href="in-game">in-games</a>. Players without a subscription may use a trial account that lets the player character reach up to level 20 but has many features locked.[15]
</P>
<p>
  To enter the game, the player must select a <a href="server">server</a>, referred to in-game as a 'realm'. Each realm acts as an individual copy of the game world and falls into one of two categories. Available realms types are:
</p>
<o>
  <li>normal – a regular type realm where the gameplay is mostly focused on defeating monsters and completing <a href="quests">quests</a>, with player-versus-player fights and any <a href="roleplay">roleplay</a> are optional.</li>
  <li>RP (<a href="roleplay">roleplay</a>) – which works the same way as a "Normal" realm, but focuses on players roleplaying in character.</li>
</ol>
<img id="level" src="images/download (2).jpeg">
<P>
<p>
  Before the introduction of World of Warcraft's seventh expansion "Battle for Azeroth", both "Normal" and "RP" servers were each divided into two separate categories: <a href="PvE">PvE</a> servers and <a href="PvP">PvP</a> servers. This has since been removed after the implementation of the "War Mode" option, which allows any player (of level 20 and higher) on any server to determine whether they want to actively participate in PvP combat or not, by enabling War Mode in two of the game's capital cities.
</p>
<p>
Realms are also categorized by language, with in-game support in the language available.[16]
</p>
Players can make new characters on all realms within the region, and it is also possible to move already established characters between realms for a fee.[17]

</div>
<p>
  To create a new character, in keeping with the storyline of previous <a href="Warcraft">Warcraft</a> games, players must choose between the opposing factions of the Alliance or the Horde; Pandaren, which were added in <a href="Mists of Pandaria">Mists of Pandaria</a>, do not commit to a faction until after the starting zone is completed. Characters from the opposing factions can perform rudimentary communication (most often just "emotes"), but only members of the same faction can speak, mail, group and join guilds. The player selects the new character's <a href="race">race</a>, such as orcs or trolls for the Horde, or humans or dwarves for the Alliance.[18] Players must select the class for the character, with choices such as mages, warriors, and priests available.[19] Most classes are limited to particular races.
</p>

  <h3>Ongoing gameplay</h3>
  </div>
<p>
  As characters become more developed, they gain various talents and skills, requiring the player to further define the abilities of that character.[20] Characters can choose two primary professions that can focus on producing items, such as tailoring, blacksmithing or jewelcrafting or on gathering from resource nodes, such as skinning or mining. Characters can learn all three secondary skills: archeology, cooking, and fishing.[21][22] Characters may form and join <a href="guilds">guilds</a>, allowing characters within the guild access to the guild's chat channel, the guild name and optionally allowing other features, including a guild tabard, guild bank, guild repairs, and dues.[23]
</p>
<p>
  Much of World of Warcraft play involves the completion of quests. These quests are usually available from <a href="NPCs">NPCs</a>.[24] Quests usually reward the player with some combination of experience points, items, and in-game money. Quests allow characters to gain access to new skills and abilities, as well as the ability to explore new areas.[25] It is through quests that much of the game's story is told, both through the quest's text and through scripted NPC actions.[26] Quests are linked by a common theme, with each consecutive quest triggered by the completion of the previous, forming a <a href="quest chain">quest chain</a>. Quests commonly involve killing a number of creatures, gathering a certain number of resources, finding a difficult to locate object, speaking to various NPCs, visiting specific locations, interacting with objects in the world, or delivering an item from one place to another to acquire experience and treasures.
</p>
<p>
  While a character can be played on its own, players can group with others to tackle more challenging content. Most end-game challenges are designed in such a way that they can only be overcome while in a group. In this way, character classes are used in specific roles within a group.[24][27] World of Warcraft uses a "rested bonus" system, increasing the rate that a character can gain experience points after the player has spent time away from the game.[20] When a character dies, it becomes a ghost—or <a href="wisp">wisp</a> for Night Elf characters—at a nearby graveyard.[25] Characters can be resurrected by other characters that have the ability or can self-resurrect by moving from the graveyard to the place where they died. If a character is past level ten and they resurrect at a graveyard, the items equipped by the character degrade, requiring in-game money and a specialist NPC to repair them. Items that have degraded heavily become unusable until they are repaired. If the location of the character's body is unreachable, they can use a special "spirit healer" NPC to resurrect at the graveyard. When the spirit healer revives a character, items equipped by the character at that time are further degraded, and the character is significantly weakened by what is in-game called "resurrection sickness" for up to ten minutes, depending on the character's level. This "resurrection sickness" does not occur and item degradation is less severe if the character revives by locating its body, or is resurrected by another player through spells or special items.[28][29]
</p>
<p>
  World of Warcraft contains a variety of mechanisms for <a href="player versus player">player versus player</a> (PvP) play. Players on <a href="player versus environment">player versus enviroment</a> (PvE) servers can opt to "flag" themselves, making themselves attackable to players of the opposite faction.[30] Depending on the mode of the realm, PvP combat between members of opposing factions is possible at almost any time or location in the game world—the only exception being the starting zones, where the PvP "flag" must be enabled by the player wishing to fight against players of the opposite faction. PvE (called normal or RP) servers, by contrast, allow a player to choose whether or not to engage in combat against other players. On both server types, there are special areas of the world where free-for-all combat is permitted. Battlegrounds, for example, are similar to dungeons: only a set number of characters can enter a single battleground, but additional copies of the battleground can be made to accommodate additional players.[31] Each battleground has a set objective, such as capturing a flag or defeating an opposing general, that must be completed to win the battleground. Competing in battlegrounds rewards the character with tokens and honor points that can be used to buy armor, weapons, and other general items that can aid a player in many areas of the game. Winning a battleground awards more honor and tokens than losing. In addition, players also earn honor when they or nearby teammates kill players in a battleground.[30]

  <h3>Setting</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    World of Warcraft is set in the same universe as the <a href="Warcraft">Warcraft</a> series of <a href="real-time strategy">real-time strategy</a> games and has a similar art direction.[15] World of Warcraft contains elements from <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a>, <a href="steampunk">steampunk</a>, and science fiction, including gryphons, dragons, elves, steam-powered automata, zombies, werewolves, other horror monsters, <a href="time travel">time travel</a>, spaceships, and alien worlds.
  </p>
  <img id="Wisp" src="images/download (1).jpeg">
<p>
  World of Warcraft takes place in a 3D representation of the Warcraft universe that players can interact with through their characters. The game world initially consisted of the two continents in Azeroth: Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms. Four separate expansions later added to the game's playable area the realms of Outland and Draenor and the continents of Northrend and Pandaria. As a player explores new locations, different routes and means of transportation become available. Players can access "flight masters" in newly discovered locations to fly to previously discovered locations in other parts of the world.[32] Players can also use boats, zeppelins, or portals to move from one continent to another. Although the game world remains relatively similar from day to day, seasonal events reflecting real world events, such as Halloween (Hallow's End),[33] Christmas (Winter Veil), Children's Week,[30] Easter (Noblegarden), and Midsummer have been represented in the game world. Locations also have variable weather including, among other things, rain, snow, and dust storms.[32]
</p>
<p>
  A number of facilities are available for characters while in towns and cities. In each major city, characters can access a bank to deposit items, such as treasures or crafted items. Each character has access to personal bank storage with the option to purchase additional storage space using in-game gold.[34] Additionally, guild banks are available for use by members of a guild with restrictions being set by the guild leader.[35] Auction houses are available for players to buy and sell items to others in a similar way to online auction sites such as eBay.[36] Players can use mailboxes, which can be found in almost every town. Mailboxes are used to collect items won at auction, and to send messages, items, and in-game money to other characters.[20]
</p>
<p>
  Some of the challenges in World of Warcraft require players to group together to complete them. These usually take place in dungeons—also known as "instances"—that a group of characters can enter together. The term "instance" comes from each group or party having a separate copy, or instance, of the dungeon, complete with their own enemies to defeat and their own treasure or rewards.[37] This allows a group to explore areas and complete quests without others interfering. Dungeons are spread over the game world and are designed for characters of varying progression. A typical dungeon will allow up to five characters to enter as part of a group. Some dungeons require more players to group together and form a "raid" of up to forty players to face some of the most difficult challenges.[38] As well as dungeon-based raid challenges, several creatures exist in the normal game environment that are designed for raids to attack.[33][39]

  <h3>Subscription</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    World of Warcraft requires a subscription to allow continued play, with options to pay in one-month, three-month, or six-month blocks, and time cards of varying lengths available from retailers, or purchasing a "WoW Token" using in-game currency.[40][41] Expansion packs are available online and from retailers. As the game client is the same regardless of the version of World of Warcraft the user owns, the option to purchase expansions online was added as it allows for a quick upgrade. World of Warcraft is also available as a free Starter Edition, which is free to play for an unlimited amount of time. Starter Edition characters are unable to gain experience after reaching level 20, and there are other restrictions in effect for Starter Edition accounts, including the inability to trade, use mail, use Auction House, use public chat channels, join guilds or amass more than ten gold.[42]
  </p>
  <p>
    In January 2015, accounts that have lapsed subscriptions, which previously would not let a player log in, work like a restricted Starter Edition account with the one difference that sub-level 20 characters will be able to join a guild if any other characters on the account are still in that guild.[43]
  </p>
<p>
  In April 2015, an alternate way to cover the subscription was introduced. A player may spend real money ($20 in North America and differing amounts in other regions) on a WoW Token, which is sold on the auction house for the in-game currency, gold, that initially could only be used to add 30 days of playtime.[41] At the launch of the feature in North America, a token sold for 30,000 gold and 24 hours later sold for 20,000 gold; therefore, the gold amount changes depending on what players are willing to spend. Subsequently, the amount that a North American token sells for remained at above 30,000 gold, and the other Battle.net regions were well above that value. Once a player buys a token on the auction house, it is account bound and cannot be resold. As of February 2017, the WoW Token can also be exchanged for $15 in Battle.net balance that can be used as credit for purchases in most of Blizzard's games as well as in <a href="Destiny 2">Destiny 2</a>.[44]

  <h3>Parent controls</h3>
</div>
<p>
  The company offers parental controls[45] that allow various limits to be set on playing time. It is possible to set a daily limit, a weekly limit, or to specify an allowed playing schedule. In order to control these settings, it is necessary to log in with different credentials than are used just to enter the game. It is also possible to receive statistics on the time spent playing. Apart from controlling children, adults sometimes use parental controls on themselves.[46] The company supports this kind of protection as otherwise the potential players or their supervisors may choose to uninstall or block the game permanently.

  Intent on settling in Durotar, <a href="Thrall's">Thrall's</a> Horde expanded its ranks by inviting the undead Forsaken to join orcs, tauren, and trolls. Meanwhile, dwarves, gnomes, and the ancient night elves pledged their loyalties to the Alliance, guided by the human kingdom of Stormwind. After Stormwind's king, Varian Wrynn, mysteriously disappeared, Highlord Bolvar Fordragon served as Regent but his service was affected by the mind control of the black dragon Onyxia, who ruled in disguise as a human noblewoman. As heroes investigated Onyxia's manipulations, the ancient elemental lord Ragnaros resurfaced to endanger both the Horde and Alliance.[47] The heroes of the Horde and Alliance defeated Onyxia and sent Ragnaros back to the Elemental Plane.

  <h3>Assault on Blackwing Lair</h3>
</div>
<p>
  Deep within Blackrock Mountain, the black dragon Nefarian conducted twisted experiments with the blood of other dragonflights. Intent on seizing the entire area for his own, he recruited the remaining Dark Horde, a rogue army that embraced the demonic bloodlust of the old Horde. These corrupt orcs, trolls, and other races battled against Ragnaros and the Dark Iron dwarves for control of the mountain. Nefarian created the twisted chromatic dragons and a legion of other aberrations in his bid to form an army powerful enough to control Azeroth and continue the legacy of his infamous father, Deathwing the Destroyer. Nefarian was vanquished by the heroes from the Horde and the Alliance.

  <h3>Rise of the Blood God</h3>
</div>
<p>
  Years ago, in the ruined temple of Atal'Hakkar, loyal priests of the Blood God Hakkar the Soulflayer attempted to summon the wrathful deity's avatar into the world. But his followers, the Atal'ai priesthood, discovered that the Soulflayer could only be summoned within the Gurubashi tribe's ancient capital, Zul'Gurub. Newly reborn in this jungle fortress, Hakkar took control of the Gurubashi tribe and mortal champions of the trolls' mighty animal gods. The Soulflayer's dark influence was halted when the Zandalari tribe recruited heroes and invaded Zul'Gurub.

  <h3>The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj</h3>
</div>
<p>
  The great desert fortress of Ahn'Qiraj, long sealed behind the Scarab Wall, was home to the insectoid qiraji, a savage race that had once mounted an assault to devastate the continent of Kalimdor. But something far more sinister lurked behind Ahn'Qiraj's walls: the Old God C'Thun, an ancient entity whose pervasive evil had suffused Azeroth since time immemorial. As C'Thun incited the qiraji to frenzy, both the Alliance and Horde prepared for a massive war effort. A mixed force of Alliance and Horde soldiers, dubbed the Might of Kalimdor, opened the gates of Ahn'Qiraj under the command of the orc Varok Saurfang. The heroes laid siege to the ruins and temples of Ahn'Qiraj and vanquished C'Thun.

  <h3>Shadow of the Necropolis</h3>
</div>
<p>
  In the Lich King's haste to spread the plague of undeath over Azeroth, he gifted one of his greatest servants, the lich Kel'Thuzad, with the flying citadel of Naxxramas, as a base of operations for the Scourge. Consistent attacks from the Scarlet Crusade and Argent Dawn factions weakened the defenses of the floating fortress, enabling an incursion from the heroes that led to Kel'Thuzad's defeat. However, a traitor among the ranks of the knightly order of the Argent Dawn ran away with Kel'Thuzad's cursed remains and fled to Northrend, where the fallen lich could be reanimated.
